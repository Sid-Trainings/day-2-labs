# 🚀 Day 2: DevOps Workshop Labs – Docker, Jenkins & Azure CI/CD

Welcome to the hands-on lab series for mastering modern DevOps practices using Docker, Jenkins, GitHub, and Azure App Services.

Each lab builds on the previous one to help you create a complete CI/CD pipeline — from containerizing applications to deploying them live on the cloud.
